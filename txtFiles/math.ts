Mr Ant moves on the Cartesian plane according to the following rules:

    1. From any lattice point (a,b), the ant may only move to (a+1,b), (a,b+1), or (a+1,b+1).
    2. There are no right angle turns in the ant's path.

Help Mr Ant calculate the number of different paths from the origin to the point (5,5).
